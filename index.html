    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      De Cairo’s Mountain and Ocean View Resort traces its beginnings 
      to December 9, 2023, when it was developed as a serene retreat overlooking 
      both the mountains and the coastline of Boljoon, Cebu. 
      Originally built as a modest rest house for family and friends by Rene Cairo Jr. also known as Junjun Cairo, the owner of the resort, it gradually 
      evolved into a full resort as more visitors began to appreciate its peaceful setting and scenic views.

    <h2>Life of the Owner</h2>
    <p>
      Rene Cairo Jr. also known as Junjun Cairo by many people, owner of 
      The De Cairo’s Resort, was born on December 9, 1983, in Ylaya, Upper 
      Becerril, Boljoon, Cebu. Now 42 years old and the sixth child in his family, he later 
      moved to Manila, where he met his wife, Margie Cairo. While 
      living in the city, Rene handled several business ventures, 
      including an alcohol business, before expanding into the hospitality 
      industry with De Cairo’s Resort. He and Margie are blessed with 
      three children—two boys and one girl.

    <h2>The success story of the business</h2>
    <p>
      The success of De Cairo’s Resort comes from the experience 
      and good business skills of its owner, Rene Cairo Jr. Before 
      opening the resort, he managed different businesses, which 
      helped him learn important skills. Because of this, 
      he was able to develop De Cairo’s Resort into a growing and 
      competitive business. With continuous improvements,and the support of his manager, 
      the resort continues to grow and keep its customers satisfied

    <h2>The challenges met by the owner</h2>
    <p>
      The founder faced several challenges when starting 
      the business, such as limited finances, difficulties 
      in completing requirements, and a lack of resources. 
      Although they had three loyal employees, managing daily 
      operations was still tough, especially when supplies or 
      food were not always enough. Even with these obstacles, 
      the business continued to operate and serve many customers, 
      steadily improving over time.
    </p>

      Resort envisions itself as a well-established and trusted 
      destination known for its peaceful ambiance, quality service,

      our facilities while maintaining sustainability and environmental

    <h2>How did the Philippine government help the business grow?</h2>
    <p>
      “The Philippine government has played a significant role in 
      supporting the growth of our business through its programs 
      for small and medium enterprises. Assistance from agencies 
      such as the Department of Tourism and local government units 
      helped promote tourism, improve infrastructure, and provide 
      business guidance. These initiatives, along with training 
      programs and regulatory support, enabled us to operate more 
      efficiently, reach a wider market, and contribute to local 
      economic development.”
